                      TorGuard VPN can protect your privacy with its robust
                      servers network and works for P2P activities,
                      but the provider needs to improve
                      unblocking and other capabilities.

                          A good VPN service must perform two essential functions for every user. First, it must hide the user’s original IP address. Second, it must encrypt all the incoming and
                          outgoing
                          data from the user’s device so that any external user can see nothing but the nearly white noise that good encryption makes of traffic.
                          <br><br>
                          Additionally, a VPN that cares about user privacy and anonymity should not keep any logs on the user activity it mediates. That’s just the basics.
                           <br><br>
                          Torguard VPN has always been beyond the basics. Its sever network is solid; it has several advanced network options, a fantastic variety of account options that allow you to
                          customize your VPN experience, and many other advantages. But, on the other hand, all that flexibility comes in exchange for lack of transparency that could turn off the
                          staunchest privacy enthusiasts.
                           <br><br>
                          Overall, TorGuard is a strong VPN that offers lots of security options. For instance, the WireGuard tunneling protocol is available in the network. In addition, it’s safe
                          against
                          IPv6 leaks; it features a Stealth proxy, it’s good for BitTorrent. A widespread and vital question is will TorGuard VPN work in China? The answer is that, yes, even in the
                          hyper-restrictive digital Chinese environment, TorGuard could work.
                           <br><br>
                          This brutally honest review of TorGuard will explore the network’s features in full detail with a particular focus on streaming, pricing, connection speeds, security, and
                          additional features.

                          The TorGuard general overview
                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                           I will go into several details about different aspects of the TorGuard network, <strong>but let’s start with the general panorama.</strong>
                          <br><br>
                          TorGuard has robust security features, <strong>it’s good against IPv6 leaks,</strong> uses the WireGuard tunneling protocol, lots of DNS options, it gives you the chance to
                          run scripts, it works well with torrents, it has a Stealth proxy, it has a free trial version and the transfer speeds are good.
                          <br><br>
                          On the other hand, split tunneling is only available for Android devices. The connections are prone to freeze. Connecting to a server can be a struggle. The user interface
                          is not the friendliest in the industry and <strong>won’t work with Netflix.</strong>
                      </p>

                          Connection speeds in TorGuard VPN
                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                          Using a VPN means that you will pay for its advantages with decreased speeds. In a VPN, your traffic gets routed through one or servers in the network, and it also gets
                          encrypted. That is extra work that needs computing and bandwidth resources, thus bringing connection speeds down. But the best VPNs in the business will do all the work
                          in the background, so you will hardly notice it, especially if your internet service is fast for a start.
                          <br><br>
                          TorGuard VPN’s speeds are good enough under most conditions. <strong>If you pick the WireGuard tunneling protocol, they will be even better.</strong> And, if
                          geolocation-related concerns are irrelevant for you, you can get the VPN to give you its best performance by choosing a server that is physically near to you.
                          <br><br>
                          As I tried several servers in the network for their speeds, <strong>I found that the fastest one (one base in Switzerland, if you must know) would decrease my transfer
                          speeds by 2.6% only.</strong> This is a significant feature because, in my experience, even the best VPNs have higher velocity losses – granted, nothing you can notice
                          in everyday use, but it shows when you measure it.
                          <br><br>
                          Another server (in Japan) caused my speeds to drop by a half. This is not a problem because that server is very far from me; it’s a typical result of the data mechanics
                          on the Internet.
                          <br><br>
                          As I mentioned, <strong>the best speeds show up when using the WireGuard protocol.</strong> But if you choose a different tunneling protocol, some extra problems pop up
                          that
                          have nothing to do with reduced speed. For instance, I had a hard time connecting to any server in the network without WireGuard. I kept being told to “check my firewall
                          settings.” This experience is unique to TorGuard VPN, as far as I can tell, and it devalues the overall service quality.
                          <br><br>
                          If sheer speed were all that mattered, TorGuard would be the best service on the Internet by far. However, high-speed VPN connections are useful only when the network
                          can sustain them in a reliable, stable way.
                          <br><br>
                          And TorGuard fails at that. I found many connections to be unreliable, and that, again, is a point against TorGuard VPN. Connections that freeze or break down are
                          particularly harmful if you intend to use this VPN to play streaming videos, which brings us to the next section.

                          TorGuard and streaming services: Does it work with Netflix and others ?
                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-0">
                         Unblocking Netflix and other video streaming platforms is the leading use case for VPNs nowadays – yes, even more than privacy issues. As a result, there is an ongoing war
                         between the video streaming industry and the VPN industry. The streaming sites are investing plenty of resources and energy in blocking VPN users. But, on the other hand,
                         the VPNs are looking to keep a step ahead by finding and exploiting loopholes, rotating IP addresses, and different strategies
                         <br><br>
                         So how does TorGuard do when it comes to unlocking websites such as Netflix, BB iPlayer, Hulu, DAZN, YouTube, or Disney+.
                         <br><br>
                         Well, I have good news and bad news for you in this department. The good news is that TorGuard <strong>works well with YouTube</strong> as it can unblock geo-blocked
                         content. The bad news is that it won’t work with any other streaming site on the Internet.
                         <br><br>
                         If you absolutely must have TorGuard unblocking streaming websites, you will need to buy a dedicated IP address to improve your chances of bypassing the restrictions.
                         This could work if the dedicated IP address you get has not been unblocked (yet) by the streaming website you have in mind.
                         <br><br>
                         So yes, there is a chance to get TorGuard to unblock Netflix if you insist. But it’s pointless to be stubborn in this regard since so many premium VPNs in the market
                         (NordVPN comes to mind) will perform this trick for you out-of-the-box, without any additional cost or requirement.

                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-0">
                         Split tunneling is available only on Android under the name of “Restricted Apps.” This is a helpful feature to have when you don’t want all your traffic to go through the
                         VPN, but you want to pick and choose the programs that will enjoy having its traffic encrypted.

                         Every app in the TorGuard tech platform offers “Scripts.” The feature will be handy for the most seasoned users though beginners could find it intimidating.
                         <br><br>
                         The Scripts feature lets you customize your VPN connection to your personal taste by running a script- plenty of example scripts to choose from at the website.
                         <br><br>
                         For instance, you can make the app automatically open a given website of your choice every time you join the VPN network, close a program, or map a network drive.
                         The possibilities are endless.

                         Suppose that a website locks your VPN’s provider DNS. With this feature, you can pick a different DNS and bypass that restriction—the options include Cloudfare,
                         OpenDNS, Google, and Level3. Cloudflare is of particular importance as it’s known to work in China.

                         TorGuard makes an effort to keep your online activities as private as possible. That’s a good thing, but it’s the least you could expect from any decent VPN, so I’m not
                         sure I can give it extra points for that.
                         <br><br>
                         Some of the best security features include intelligence-grade encryption, WireGuard tunneling, WebRTC and IPv6 leak prevention, and a kill switch. Again, this is all very
                         good, but also the least I should expect. So let’s see these features in a little more detail.

                          Encryption
                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                         The encryption algorithm is AES-256, which comes as no surprise. Every reliable VPN in the industry uses AES by default. AES has been audited and studied to the highest
                         possible degree, and no attack has been found so far that could crack it by any method other than brute force – and then, cracking it in that way takes longer than the
                         universe’s age. This is why AES has been adopted by every industry and governmental agency in the US and most of the world.
                         <br><br>
                         The OpenVPN tunneling protocol allows you to change to AES-128 if you so wish. It’s a quicker method, of course, and it could seem weaker at first glance. However, the truth
                         is that nobody has been able to crack the 128-bit version either, so it’s a safe bet.
                         <br><br>
                         You can also choose to use Blowfish instead of AES (it could be faster in those devices that do not support AES as a hardware instruction) or do away with encryption
                         completely. But these advanced features are available only through manual configuration, not from the app.
                         <br><br>
                         Last but not least, authentication is managed with an SHA-512 hash, which is exceedingly safe – it’s the exact security mechanism in charge of the Bitcoin blockchain
                         network.

                         TorGuard VPN is headquartered in Florida, in the USA. Unfortunately, this is usually not great news for VPNs because the USA is notoriously hostile towards user privacy,
                         and its government has a penchant for spying on its citizens. And the legislation could force TorGuard VPN’s parent company to spill the beans on you if need be.
                         <br><br>
                         So how can you join TorGuard as a user and keep your peace of mind? The answer is on its privacy policy. The website assures users that it doesn’t collect any user activity
                         logs. So nothing you do online is either tracked or recorded anywhere in the network. This is why, at least in principle, you can still trust US-based VPNs.
                         <br><br>
                         If they keep no logs on you, they have nothing they can pass on to the government if they should be required to do so. That being said, the most paranoid users among us
                         still prefer to choose no logs VPNs located in countries with a well-known stance in favor of user privacy, but that’s up to you.
                         <br><br>
                         However, there is some data that TorGuard collects. Payment details, Google Analytics data (anonymized), Apache logs, email addresses, and anything you type on a live chat.
                         This brings a degree of ambiguity to the VPN’s promise to keep your privacy safe.
                         <br><br>
                         And to finish this section, I have some bad news. Some of the best VPNs in the industry, like ExpressVPN, NordVPN, or SurfShark (these three happen to be my top three
                         choices for any VPN-related task), have undergone thorough independent audits and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately, TorGuard VPN hasn’t been audited so far, which
                         doesn’t add to its credibility.

                         A kill switch is a feature that disconnects your system from the Internet when it detects that you have lost access to the secured encryption tunnel. This ensures that you
                         will never be broadcasting any data to the world through an open connection.
                         <br><br>
                         There is also an “App Kill” option which is highly customizable. With it, you can ensure that an application of your choice will be closed if you lose the VPN connection.

                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                         This network spans more than 50 countries, and it has more than 3,000 servers around the globe. Each of those supports WireGuard and torrenting. Those numbers are pretty
                         impressive even when you contrast them with some of the most extensive VPN networks in the industry.
                         <br><br>
                         However, the size alone doesn’t guarantee uniform global coverage. Africa and the Middle East are the glaring examples as only four countries in that vast geographic area
                         host servers for TorGuard.
                         <br><br>
                         TorGuard’s apps and website don’t include a map for the network, which is something I’ve come to expect from any good VPN. Instead, you have to pick your server from a
                         list, which makes things a little awkward when you have a particular region in mind.

                         Whatever plan you choose to join TorGuard, you’ll get the same features. I haven’t mentioned so far the number of concurrent connections allowed to a single account. It’s
                         eight, which is higher than most but lower than some others that allow for unlimited devices simultaneously.
                         <br><br>
                         The monthly plan will set you back by 10 USD. That’s the exact average price you find across the VPN industry, so it’s neither cheap nor expensive. If you are not afraid of
                         commitment, the 12 months and 6-month plan will cost you 4.99 per month and 6.66 for the Quarterly plan.
                         <br><br>
                         So the pricing options are nothing extraordinary, but all the opposite. They are at the top of the average. So this VPN is not a great deal in terms of price, but it’s not
                         a waste of your money either.

                       Yes, there is a 7-day free trial in TorGuard. And getting it is one of the most surrealistic experiences you can have in the VPN industry.
                       <br><br>
                       If you want to have your seven-day trial on TorGuard, you first need to subscribe to another VPN, send a copy of your last bill to freshstart@torguard.net. Once your
                       documentation is certified, you will have seven days of full TorGuard access.
                       <br><br>
                       And there’s more.
                       <br><br>
                       If you end up deciding that you like TorGuard better than your previous VPN vendor, you can send proof of account cancelation to the customer support team and have a free
                       30-day trial in addition.

                       Every TorGuard app is minimalistic, and they all look very much alike. Unfortunately, this characteristic takes away from its ability to be user-friendly, especially for
                       users who have little or no experience using VPNs.
                       <br><br>
                       I already mentioned the lack of a map to select servers. The settings section looks like something that an expert designed with other experts in mind – experts with a great
                       deal of experience using VPNs. So inexperienced users will find the settings to be a labyrinth, without the ability to tell which settings are fundamental and which are not.

                       There are desktop apps available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and they all look pretty much the same – again. It’s not that often that I find a VPN offering a dedicated
                       Linux app, so this is a point in favor of TorGuard VPN, except that Linux users continue to be in a minority when it comes to PCs.

                       While both iOS and Android apps look the same, there are a few significant differences. For example, Android gives you OpenVPN and WireGuard. iOS also gives you OpenVPN and
                       IKEv2/IPSec but no WireGuard. And, besides WireGuard being exclusive to the Android app, split tunneling is also unavailable for iOS devices. These would suggest that the
                       Android app is better than the iOS one. But it’s not. It’s buggy. It freezes easily, and the connections are slower than in Windows.

                        What you can do instead is to create a service ticket at any time of the day. Issuing a ticket will, of course, need for you to present your network credentials. I found
                        this process to be unreliable and cumbersome.

                        On the other hand, you can also request help by sending an email to helpdesk@torguard.net. I found this option to be better, and it doesn’t need that you provide any

                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                        So it’s time to address the big question: should you or not pick TorGuard as your VPN provider?
                        <br><br>
                        TorGuard is a robust service. The security is impeccable, and the speeds are probably the best in the industry. In addition, it allows for a very high degree of
                        customization, and the most advanced users among us will have a field day setting up their accounts. Finally, it’s excellent for torrents.
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand, it’s useless for unblocking video stream sites, which had become a significant use case for VPNs. The connections are unreliable, and if you are not
                        using WireGuard, you can have a hard time even connecting to a server. The platform is not friendly towards VPN newbies.
                        <br><br>
                        So when I put all that information together, my conclusion is that no, you should not pick TorGuard. Why? NordVPN will give you all the advantages of TorGuard for the
                        same price, SurfShark will do the same for a fraction of the cost, and in ExpressVPN, you will pay a couple more dollars but you will get a better service overall.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition, all the three VPNs I mentioned as better options will unblock Netflix and many other streaming services. Moreover, all those three VPNs are located in
                        privacy-friendly jurisdictions, and they have passed independent audits with flying colors.
                        <br><br>
                        With all that in mind, is there still a case to be made to join TorGuard? Yes. If you try this service and you find that it’s just right for you because of the speeds,
                        performance in the BitTorrent network, or because you don’t use Netflix at all, then you’ve found your perfect match, and you will lose nothing by joining in.
                        <br><br>
                        So yes, you should pick TorGuard VPN if you find that it suits your needs perfectly. But as a general-purpose VPN, this is not the best choice in the market, and you will
                        be better off choosing several better VPN networks that charge you the same monthly fee for higher-quality service.
                        <br><br>
                        TorGuard VPN is a good VPN. But it’s not good enough just yet. You’d be better off choosing any of the three alternatives mentioned already, especially NordVPN.
