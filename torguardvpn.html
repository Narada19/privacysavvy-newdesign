                      TorGuard VPN review: Good for <strong> privacy </strong> and <strong>P2P activities</strong> but not for other purposes

                  <p class="textp">
                      TorGuard VPN can protect your privacy with its robust
                      servers network and works for P2P activities,
                      but the provider needs to improve
                      unblocking and other capabilities.

                          A good VPN service must perform two essential functions for every user. First, it must hide the user’s original IP address. Second, it must encrypt all the incoming and
                          outgoing
                          data from the user’s device so that any external user can see nothing but the nearly white noise that good encryption makes of traffic.
                          <br><br>
                          Additionally, a VPN that cares about user privacy and anonymity should not keep any logs on the user activity it mediates. That’s just the basics.
                           <br><br>
                          Torguard VPN has always been beyond the basics. Its sever network is solid; it has several advanced network options, a fantastic variety of account options that allow you to
                          customize your VPN experience, and many other advantages. But, on the other hand, all that flexibility comes in exchange for lack of transparency that could turn off the
                          staunchest privacy enthusiasts.
                           <br><br>
                          Overall, TorGuard is a strong VPN that offers lots of security options. For instance, the WireGuard tunneling protocol is available in the network. In addition, it’s safe
                          against
                          IPv6 leaks; it features a Stealth proxy, it’s good for BitTorrent. A widespread and vital question is will TorGuard VPN work in China? The answer is that, yes, even in the
                          hyper-restrictive digital Chinese environment, TorGuard could work.
                           <br><br>
                          This brutally honest review of TorGuard will explore the network’s features in full detail with a particular focus on streaming, pricing, connection speeds, security, and
                          additional features.

                          The TorGuard general overview
                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                           I will go into several details about different aspects of the TorGuard network, <strong>but let’s start with the general panorama.</strong>
                          <br><br>
                          TorGuard has robust security features, <strong>it’s good against IPv6 leaks,</strong> uses the WireGuard tunneling protocol, lots of DNS options, it gives you the chance to
                          run scripts, it works well with torrents, it has a Stealth proxy, it has a free trial version and the transfer speeds are good.
                          <br><br>
                          On the other hand, split tunneling is only available for Android devices. The connections are prone to freeze. Connecting to a server can be a struggle. The user interface
                          is not the friendliest in the industry and <strong>won’t work with Netflix.</strong>

                          Connection speeds in TorGuard VPN
                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                          Using a VPN means that you will pay for its advantages with decreased speeds. In a VPN, your traffic gets routed through one or servers in the network, and it also gets
                          encrypted. That is extra work that needs computing and bandwidth resources, thus bringing connection speeds down. But the best VPNs in the business will do all the work
                          in the background, so you will hardly notice it, especially if your internet service is fast for a start.
                          <br><br>
                          TorGuard VPN’s speeds are good enough under most conditions. <strong>If you pick the WireGuard tunneling protocol, they will be even better.</strong> And, if
                          geolocation-related concerns are irrelevant for you, you can get the VPN to give you its best performance by choosing a server that is physically near to you.
                          <br><br>
                          As I tried several servers in the network for their speeds, <strong>I found that the fastest one (one base in Switzerland, if you must know) would decrease my transfer
                          speeds by 2.6% only.</strong> This is a significant feature because, in my experience, even the best VPNs have higher velocity losses – granted, nothing you can notice
                          in everyday use, but it shows when you measure it.
                          <br><br>
                          Another server (in Japan) caused my speeds to drop by a half. This is not a problem because that server is very far from me; it’s a typical result of the data mechanics
                          on the Internet.
                          <br><br>
                          As I mentioned, <strong>the best speeds show up when using the WireGuard protocol.</strong> But if you choose a different tunneling protocol, some extra problems pop up that
                          have nothing to do with reduced speed. For instance, I had a hard time connecting to any server in the network without WireGuard. I kept being told to “check my firewall
                          settings.” This experience is unique to TorGuard VPN, as far as I can tell, and it devalues the overall service quality.
                          <br><br>
                          If sheer speed were all that mattered, TorGuard would be the best service on the Internet by far. However, high-speed VPN connections are useful only when the network
                          can sustain them in a reliable, stable way.
                          <br><br>
                          And TorGuard fails at that. I found many connections to be unreliable, and that, again, is a point against TorGuard VPN. Connections that freeze or break down are
                          particularly harmful if you intend to use this VPN to play streaming videos, which brings us to the next section.

                          TorGuard and streaming services: Does it work with Netflix and others ?
                      </h2>
                       <p class="textp pl-2 pb-10">
                         Unblocking Netflix and other video streaming platforms is the leading use case for VPNs nowadays – yes, even more than privacy issues. As a result, there is an ongoing war
                         between the video streaming industry and the VPN industry. The streaming sites are investing plenty of resources and energy in blocking VPN users. But, on the other hand,
                         the VPNs are looking to keep a step ahead by finding and exploiting loopholes, rotating IP addresses, and different strategies
                         <br><br>
                         So how does TorGuard do when it comes to unlocking websites such as Netflix, BB iPlayer, Hulu, DAZN, YouTube, or Disney+.
                         <br><br>
                         Well, I have good news and bad news for you in this department. The good news is that TorGuard <strong>works well with YouTube</strong> as it can unblock geo-blocked content.
                         The bad news is that it won’t work with any other streaming site on the Internet.
                         <br><br>
                         If you absolutely must have TorGuard unblocking streaming websites, you will need to buy a dedicated IP address to improve your chances of bypassing the restrictions.
                         This could work if the dedicated IP address you get has not been unblocked (yet) by the streaming website you have in mind.
                         <br><br>
                         So yes, there is a chance to get TorGuard to unblock Netflix if you insist. But it’s pointless to be stubborn in this regard since so many premium VPNs in the market
                         (NordVPN comes to mind) will perform this trick for you out-of-the-box, without any additional cost or requirement.

                         Split tunneling is available only on Android under the name of “Restricted Apps.” This is a helpful feature to have when you don’t want all your traffic to go through the
                         VPN, but you want to pick and choose the programs that will enjoy having its traffic encrypted.
